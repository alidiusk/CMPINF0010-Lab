## Miscellany
MIT License was chosen because CMPINF0010-Lab is a project that would benefit from rapid expansion and 
open source collaboration. The MIT License is a way to protect ourselves and still promote contributions.


The code of conduct was created from scratch since CMPINF0010-Lab is a small project that needed
a code of conduct specific to the project. When writing the code of conduct, incluscivity, rewarding individual contributions, and respectful communication was emphasized.
